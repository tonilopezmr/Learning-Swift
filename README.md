# Learning-Swift

Learning Swift first steps.

I use this awesome page to learn [Swift Language Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0)

My First IOS App is MVP (Model-View-Presenter) framework written in Swift based on [Karumi IOS Repository](https://github.com/Karumi/KataSuperHeroesIOS)
